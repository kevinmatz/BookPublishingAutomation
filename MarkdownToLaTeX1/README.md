Computing project structure
To create a command-line tool that takes a Markdown file as input and outputs a LaTeX file formatted as a book, we would need the following files:
1. `main.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It will handle command-line arguments, call the appropriate functions to convert the Markdown to LaTeX, and output the result.
2. `markdown_parser.py`: This file will contain the logic to parse the Markdown file. It will read the Markdown file, parse it into a data structure that can be easily manipulated, and return this data structure.
3. `latex_generator.py`: This file will take the data structure returned by `markdown_parser.py` and generate LaTeX code from it. It will handle the formatting of the LaTeX file to make it look like a book.
4. `utils.py`: This file will contain utility functions that are used by the other files. For example, it might contain a function to read a file, a function to write to a file, etc.
5. `requirements.txt`: This file will list the Python packages that need to be installed for the tool to work. For example, it might list a package for parsing Markdown and a package for generating LaTeX.
The order of creation should be `utils.py`, `markdown_parser.py`, `latex_generator.py`, `main.py`, and finally `requirements.txt`. This is because `utils.py` contains utility functions that might be used by the other Python files, `markdown_parser.py` and `latex_generator.py` are used by `main.py`, and `requirements.txt` is usually created last as it lists all the dependencies of the project.
Now, let's call the function with these filenames:
```typescript
functions.outputFileNames({
  fileNames: ["utils.py", "markdown_parser.py", "latex_generator.py", "main.py", "requirements.txt"]
});
```
Step 1
Finding related files for utils.py
{
  "dependencies": []
}
Step 2
Generating utils.py

Thinking...
Sure, here is the `utils.py` file. This file will contain utility functions that can be used across the project. For this project, we can have a function to read the input Markdown file and another function to write the output LaTeX file.
