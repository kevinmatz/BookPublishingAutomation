Please build me a website using Python and Django with user authentication. The login page should have a button or link that allows a user to create a user account. Users can only access the protected Hello World page if they have created a user account and logged in.

Step 0
Computing project structure
To create a Django project with user authentication, you will need to create several files. Here's a list of the files you'll need and the order in which they should be created:
1. `manage.py`: This is the command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project. It's automatically created when you start a new Django project.
2. `settings.py`: This file contains all the configuration of your Django installation. This file is also automatically created when you start a new Django project.
3. `urls.py`: This file is responsible for routing the different URLs that your application will use.
4. `models.py`: This file is where you'll define the data models for your application. In this case, you'll need to define a User model.
5. `forms.py`: This file will contain the forms for user registration and login.
6. `views.py`: This file will contain the views for your application. You'll need to create views for the login page, the registration page, and the protected Hello World page.
7. `templates/registration/login.html`: This is the template for the login page.
8. `templates/registration/register.html`: This is the template for the registration page.
9. `templates/hello_world.html`: This is the template for the protected Hello World page.
Now, let's call the function with these filenames:
```typescript
functions.outputFileNames({
  fileNames: [
   "manage.py",
   "settings.py",
   "urls.py",
   "models.py",
   "forms.py",
   "views.py",
   "templates/registration/login.html",
   "templates/registration/register.html",
   "templates/hello_world.html"
  ]
});
```
